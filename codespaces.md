## Codespace Templates by GitHub Partners

Codespace Templates provide developers with preconfigured environments to streamline project setup and development. Designed to eliminate the hassle of manual configuration, these templates allow users to start coding immediately, whether working alone or in teams. Created and maintained by GitHub Partners, the templates cover a variety of programming languages and frameworks, such as Python, Java, React, and more. Partners must be members of the GitHub Technology Partner Program and are responsible for maintaining documentation and supporting users.

Note: While GitHub expects partners to deliver these templates in good faith, it does not independently verify them.
