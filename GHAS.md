# ðŸ”’ GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) Integrations

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) offers a robust suite of tools to identify and remediate vulnerabilities within your codebase. By integrating GHAS with third-party platforms like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) services and vulnerability management tools, organizations can gain deeper insights into their application security posture and streamline workflows.

## ðŸš€ Integration Highlights

### External Reporting and Analytics
Integrating GHAS with external reporting platforms allows organizations to:
- Extract and ingest GitHub alerts into tools like Splunk, Datadog, and ServiceNow.
- Visualize security metrics to monitor vulnerabilities and trends.
- Enhance visibility into application security across the entire development lifecycle.

**Key strategies for integration include:**
- Methods for extracting and ingesting data from GitHub.
- Ideal workflows for seamless integration.
- Metrics to prioritize in your reporting or SIEM tool.
