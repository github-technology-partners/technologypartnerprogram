# ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Extensions

## What are Copilot Extensions?

GitHub Copilot Extensions are powerful tools that expand the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, enabling developers to go beyond simple code suggestions and incorporate more comprehensive workflows. These extensions help developers write code, retrieve data, and solve complex problems more efficiently, creating an intuitive, natural language-driven workflow that enhances productivity. 

*‚ÄúThis is the future of software development, where developers spend less time searching and more time building. Working in natural language, they can write code, retrieve data, and solve problems, all using a single intuitive workflow.‚Äù* ‚Äî Tillman Elser, Engineering Manager at Sentry.
