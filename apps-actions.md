# ðŸš€ Apps and Actions: Deployment Protection Rules

## Overview of Deployment Protection Rules

Deployment protection rules ensure that specific conditions are met before a job referencing an environment can continue. These rules help maintain control and reliability during the deployment process. GitHub supports various types of deployment protection rules, such as:

- **Manual Reviewer**: Requires a person to approve the deployment.
- **Time Delay**: Introduces a wait period before a deployment can proceed.
- **Branch Restrictions**: Limits deployment to specific branches.

### Custom Deployment Protection Rules

One of the most impactful features is the ability for customers to create and use **Custom Deployment Protection Rules** powered by GitHub Apps. This allows third-party systems to control deployments, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before proceeding. Custom rules provide flexibility and can be tailored to meet the unique requirements of each organization.
